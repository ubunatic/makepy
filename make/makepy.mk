# Integration and Usage
# ---------------------
# Simply `include make/makepy.mk` to include all mk files in your `Makefile`.
# Now you can use `make vars`, `make pyclean`, and `make dev-install`.

# This file provides targets that wrap the most common makepy commands, so that you
# can call makepy commands and custom targets together: `make <makepy-command> <custom-target>`.
# It also includes all other mk files so that you only need to `include make/makepy.mk`

.PHONY: dists install dev-install tox bumpversion version

include make/vars.mk

# passthrough makepy commands
